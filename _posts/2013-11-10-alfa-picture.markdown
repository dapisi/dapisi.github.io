### Preparation

Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale a tale of a fateful trip that started from this tropic port aboard this tiny ship. If you have a problem if no one else can help and if you can find them maybe you can hire The A-Team! I have always wanted to have a neighbor just like you. 

I've always wanted to live in a neighborhood with you. Here's the story of a lovely lady who was bringing up three very lovely girls. 

### Shooting

The weather started getting rough - the tiny ship was tossed. If not for the courage of the fearless crew the Minnow would be lost. the Minnow would be lost. Maybe you and me were never meant to be. But baby think of me once in awhile. I'm at WKRP in Cincinnati. And we'll do it our way yes our way. Make all our dreams come true for me and you?

Makin their way the only way they know how. That's just a little bit more than the law will allow. They're creepy and they're kooky mysterious and spooky. They're all together ooky the Addams Family. Come and listen to a story about a man named Jed - a poor mountaineer barely kept his family fed.

Were gonna do it. Give us any chance well take it. Give us any rule we'll break it. We're gonna make our dreams come true. Goodbye gray sky hello blue. There's nothing can hold me when I hold you. Feels so right it cant be wrong. Rockin' and rollin' all week long.
